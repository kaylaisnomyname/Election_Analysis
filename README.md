## Challenge Overview
The challenges include how to import/read/analysis the resource file and output analysis results to a readable file, and how to construct functioning code blocks.

## Challenge Summary
- get access to the resource file
  - import dependencies, using methods of dependecies to set proper path to the source data
- read the resource file
  - use methods of dependencies to read file
- output to result file
  - .write() method
- Proper indention for functional blocks
